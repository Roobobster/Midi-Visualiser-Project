# Midi-Visualiser-Project
Midi Visualiser in the form of a very basic microgame.

Game is made in unity and you can import the files into a unity project.
Was made long time ago and hasn't been updated since and is very crude way of completing a midi visualiser in the form of a game.
The concept is there but needs refinement for a more enjoyable experience.

To add songs you will need the midi file (most seem to work but some don't get parsed correctly since midi files are stored very weirdly)
Then you will need to add a song file for it to play at the same time in the music folder. Then add the name of the file on the player eventspawner.
